Hi, you requested a Facebook friendship with me. Do we know each other and what led you to the FB friendship request?

I receive a lot of Facebook friendship requests from people I do not know and if the people do not introduce themselves I ingore the requests. If we've met and I do not remember, please excuse me and remind me where we've met.

Thank you for your consideration!

Nikolay
