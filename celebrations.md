# On celebrations

## Name Day

- I do not celebrate name days, neither mine nor of others.
- Please do not call me, send greetings or gifts on a day that some consider to be my name day.

## Explanation

- Traditions are habits. Habits can be useful and not useful.
- I do not support traditions that are not useful from my perspective - creating value, fulfilling a need, have a deeper meaning for the participants, etc.
