# Giving Birthday 2016

Dear friend,

I invite you to my birthday on 1. April 2016, Friday, at 18:00 (German time) in Berlin and also online!

Few years ago I was totally dissatisfied with the old traditional way to celebrate birthdays: 1) the birthday person receives presents that are often not needed and asks him/herself what to do with them. 2) the birthday guest feels like he/she should buy a present, spends time asking himself/herself what to buy, shopping, packaging, etc, etc - waste of time, resources and money.

Then in 2011 I decided to leave this wasteful societal tradition and celebrate my birthday the way I want. "The Giving Birthday" (aka "Sharing Birthday") was born with the idea instead of receiving, to give/create what I want and love. I had one desktop computer and asked my mother, a math teacher, to find the smartest kid who needs a computer. And this was my first giving present on my birthday. I believe that the birthday should reflect the life of the person who has it. Since 2011 I donated to organizations working with Open Hardware and Permaculture, gave money to another kid in need, a friend contributing a lot to the common good, and a little bit to >20 eco socially active people.

This year is my 6th Giving/Sharing Birthday and instead of giving money I decided to share with you (and everyone) the best things I've learned until now:
- the Best and Worst experiences in my life: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uq1rR8KK6XQfiyS4K4zicI2u8z0wQKv0rMkvXw9MuPw/edit#
- the Best and Worst experiences in 2016: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZNzgIZM_4frdxstQToa6gJ6ouQgSn3PKrgklP9hEhBg/edit
- my Life Learnings (what I would share if I die now): http://nikolaygeorgiev.cc/#learnings

Also during the birthday, for those present physically and online, there will be a short time period during which everyone of us could share his/hers love/inspirations, actions and needs, or whatever you want.

We will create and share lots of healthy food, including the Salad Of Love :)

So feel warmly welcome!
