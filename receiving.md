# My view and wishes on receiving presents/stuff

* Please DO NOT buy, give or send me any presents and stuff without my explicit consent!
* Otherwise you are wasing the time, resources and energy of: you, me, everyone involved in the process and nature.
* By giving without the receiver needing it, you create and multiply waste at the highest degree.

Thank you for your consideration!
